WWDC2013
========

Every year Apple gives out a select number of Student Scholarships to their World Wide Developers Conference. 
This year the application entailed several essays and required students to make "An app about ourselves."
I applied, won a scholarship, and this is the app that I submitted. 

It's simple, and even a bit cheesey, but it did help me get to California for an awesome week at WWDC.

There may be a few typos, the application deadline fell on finals week, and I literally submited my 
application minutes before the deadline.

Some Details
============

The app was written using the Cocos2D 2.x framework. It has been optimized to make use of ARC.
